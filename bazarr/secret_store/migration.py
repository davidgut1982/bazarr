"""Bidirectional secret crossing between in-memory plaintext and on-disk
ciphertext.

The model:
- In memory (`settings.sonarr.apikey`, etc.): always plaintext. Application
  code reads creds the same way it always has.
- On disk (`config.yaml`): always ciphertext, post-migration. The first-
  boot-after-upgrade path is plaintext; the bootstrap decrypter is a
  passthrough on plaintext (`decrypt_secret` returns plaintext unchanged
  when the marker prefix is missing) and the next `write_config()`
  rewrites the file in encrypted form. Auto-migration is implicit -
  there is no separate one-shot script.

Two boundaries:
1. After dynaconf finishes loading config.yaml: walk USER_VISIBLE_SECRETS
   and decrypt anything carrying the marker prefix. After this runs, the
   live settings object holds plaintext for every credential.
2. Inside `write_config()`: snapshot settings as a dict, encrypt every
   USER_VISIBLE_SECRETS in the snapshot, persist that. Only the
   snapshot is encrypted; the live settings object stays plaintext.
