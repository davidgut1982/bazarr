"""Bidirectional secret crossing between in-memory plaintext and on-disk
ciphertext.

The model:
- In memory (`settings.sonarr.apikey`, etc.): always plaintext. Application
  code reads creds the same way it always has.
- On disk (`config.yaml`): always ciphertext, post-migration. The first-
  boot-after-upgrade path is plaintext; the bootstrap decrypter is a
  passthrough on plaintext (`decrypt_secret` returns plaintext unchanged
  when the marker prefix is missing) and the next `write_config()`
  rewrites the file in encrypted form. Auto-migration is implicit -
  there is no separate one-shot script.

Two boundaries:
1. After dynaconf finishes loading config.yaml: walk USER_VISIBLE_SECRETS
   and decrypt anything carrying the marker prefix. After this runs, the
   live settings object holds plaintext for every credential.
2. Inside `write_config()`: snapshot settings as a dict, encrypt every
   USER_VISIBLE_SECRETS in the snapshot, persist that. Only the
   snapshot is encrypted; the live settings object stays plaintext.

    BEFORE decrypt_settings_in_place - the legacy ciphertext does NOT
    carry the enc:v1: marker, so without this conversion the unified
    pipeline would treat the legacy bytes as plaintext, the next write
    would re-encrypt them as if they were a credential, and the user's
    plex creds would be unrecoverable.

    The legacy plex.encryption_key stays in config.yaml (it's still a
    SYSTEM_SECRET masked by the API serializer) so the migration is
    one-way safe: a downgrade post-this-version can't read enc:v1:
    ciphertext anyway, so leaving the legacy key around is harmless and
    avoids a destructive deletion in the migration path.

    Trigger semantics: detection is value-shaped, NOT flag-shaped. The
    legacy apikey path set `plex.apikey_encrypted = True`, but the OAuth
    flow stored `settings.plex.token = encrypt_token(...)` and never
    touched that flag. Gating on `apikey_encrypted` left OAuth tokens
    untouched, the unified pipeline then encrypted the legacy URLSafe
    payload as if it were plaintext, and Plex got the unwrapped JSON
    blob as the auth token after decrypt - breaking OAuth users on
    upgrade.

    Approach: when plex.encryption_key is non-empty, attempt
    `TokenManager.decrypt` on every legacy field. URLSafeSerializer
    raises on plaintext / empty / already-unified-marker values, so
    the same code path covers both the apikey-encrypted flag case AND
    the OAuth-no-flag case without false positives.
