"""Per-key sliding-window counter for /download quota enforcement.

Window is fixed-interval (not true rolling), so within a window a caller
can consume up to `limit` downloads; at window boundary the count resets.
In-memory only, single-node. Keyed by JWT jti for the compat flow.

Stale entries are only pruned lazily: a jti that consumes once and never
returns leaves its (window_start, count) tuple behind until the same jti
calls again. At default config the map grows by at most one entry per
logged-in JWT per day, so single-node memory usage is bounded well below
concern even over weeks of churn. If that assumption changes (multi-node,
or an abusive client rotating JWTs), add periodic pruning here."""
